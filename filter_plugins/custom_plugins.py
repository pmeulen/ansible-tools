# Custom filter plugins for use with Ansible.
# Defines two filters: "vault" and "depem"

# Filter: "vault"
# Example: {{ foo | vault(vault_keydir) }}
# Decrypts the contents of the Ansible variable "foo" with the keyczar key that is stored in the
# directory specified in the Ansible "vault_keydir" variable

# Filter: "depem"
# Example: {{ foo | depem }}
# Remove the PEM headers and whitespace from a string. When used on a PEM encoded X.509 certificate this
# will leave just the base64 encoded part, ready to use in e.g. a XML dsig X509Certificate element.


# decrypt string "encrypted: using key stored in "keydir".
# Compatible with python2 and python3, but for python2 use python-keyczar and for python3 use python3-keyczar
